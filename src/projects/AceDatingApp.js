                &nbsp;Why is ACE visibility low? Can we create an app to bypass

            </span>
            <br></br>
            Asexual visibility may be low for a variety of reasons, including a
            lack of representation in media and popular culture, as well as a
            lack of understanding or awareness of asexuality within society as a
            whole. An asexual dating app could potentially help to increase
            visibility by creating a space specifically for asexual individuals
            to connect and find support. However, it's important to note that
            simply highlighting people's sexuality or orientation may not be
            sufficient to fully address the issue of visibility. It may also be
            helpful to consider ways to educate and raise awareness about
            asexuality to a wider audience.

            </span>
            <br></br>
            An asexual dating app could potentially be useful for individuals of

            looking for relationships that are not focused on physical intimacy.
            However, it's important to consider the needs and preferences of the
            target audience for the app, which in this case would be asexual
            individuals.

            <br></br>A While it is not publicly known what algorithm the

            characteristics and features of profiles to make recommendations.
            It's important to note that the effectiveness of a recommendation
            algorithm will depend on the quality and quantity of data available,
            as well as the specific goals and needs of the app. Testing and
            fine-tuning the algorithm over time can help to improve its
            performance and accuracy.

            are new to the concept or still exploring their own identity.
            However, it's also important to consider whether this would be
            patronizing or not, as everyone has different learning styles and
            preferences. It might be helpful to include a variety of resources,
            such as articles, blog posts, and videos, and allow users to choose
            which ones they would like to access.

            physical intimacy, it might be helpful to include features or tools
            that allow users to clearly communicate their boundaries and
            preferences. For example, users could have the option to specify
            their relationship goals or preferences in their profile, and the
            app could include features that allow users to have conversations
            about these topics before meeting in person. Additionally, it could
            be helpful to include resources or support for users who may be
            feeling pressure to conform to societal expectations around
            relationships and intimacy.
