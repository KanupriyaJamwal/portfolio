                &nbsp;Why is ACE visibility low? Can we create an app to bypass

            </span>
            <br></br>
            Asexual visibility may be low for a variety of reasons, including a
            lack of representation in media and popular culture, as well as a
            lack of understanding or awareness of asexuality within society as a
            whole. An asexual dating app could potentially help to increase
            visibility by creating a space specifically for asexual individuals
            to connect and find support. However, it's important to note that
            simply highlighting people's sexuality or orientation may not be
            sufficient to fully address the issue of visibility. It may also be
            helpful to consider ways to educate and raise awareness about
            asexuality to a wider audience.

            An asexual dating app could potentially be useful for individuals of

            However, it's important to consider the needs and preferences of the
            target audience for the app, which in this case would be asexual
            individuals.

            It's important to note that the effectiveness of a recommendation
            algorithm will depend on the quality and quantity of data available,
            as well as the specific goals and needs of the app. Testing and

            However, it's also important to consider whether this would be
            patronizing or not, as everyone has different learning styles and

            preferences. For example, users could have the option to specify
            their relationship goals or preferences in their profile, and the
            app could include features that allow users to have conversations
            about these topics before meeting in person. Additionally, it could
            be helpful to include resources or support for users who may be
            feeling pressure to conform to societal expectations around
            relationships and intimacy.
