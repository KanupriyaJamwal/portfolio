            In our 6th semester of engineering (early 2019), we had 8 subjects
            and one of them was an elective - Human Computer Interface üòÄ
            <br></br>
            This was my favourite subject and it later got me interested in UX
            Design. For our HCI project, my friend and I designed the UI for an
            ATM for kids.
          </p>
          <p className="reflections col-2">
            The other elective was Operation Research.

        <h2 className="large-spacer-top col-5">Purpose of the system</h2>
        <div className="text-group">
          <p className="large-paragraph medium-spacer-bottom col-5">
            There are a number of ATMs with good UIs available but none of them
            focus on children‚Äôs requirements. We believe that it‚Äôs important to
            educate children about money management early on. <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The core functionality of Banksy is to let children withdraw and
            parents deposit money. We have added more functionalities that we
            believe would encourage kids to save money.
          </p>
          <p className="reflections col-2">
            Although, IDBI now offers 'POWERKIDZ' account for children.

        </div>
        <h2 className="large-spacer-top col-5">Scope of the system</h2>
        <div className="text-group">
          <p className="large-paragraph medium-spacer-bottom col-5">
            Banksy has an interface which has customisable themes and caters to
            children‚Äôs love for cartoons. It gives limited options on-screen but
            has all the functionalities that are necessary, with a few extended
            functionalities.
          </p>

        <h2 className="large-spacer-top col-5">User Profiling</h2>
        <div className="text-group">
          <p className="large-paragraph medium-spacer-bottom col-5">
            The target users are kids aged 8-12. Information was gathered by
            conversing with kids of these ages at malls and other public places
            (with consent of parents). This information includes colour scheme
            preferences, their allowances, the places they frequent, etc. We
            kept in mind the money management education they may have received.
            We implemented it in a way that encourages them to save money.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            There is a separate login for parents so they can set preferences
            such as setting an allowance limit and accessing account details.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Kids usually spend more time on the screen and are significantly
            tech savvy. They also like to personalize their profiles.
          </p>
          <p className="reflections col-2">
            This was in late 2018, early 2019 so I feel like it's a bit outdated
            now.

              the model as a series of commands to be executed on the model.
            </li>
            <li>The design of a seamless navigation capability.</li>

              The interface must be designed to engage the attention of

              Users must not be able to withdraw more than Rs. 500 in 24 days

            <li>Users may choose colour scheme via avatars</li>
            <li>Scratch can be availed with every withdrawal</li>
            <li>
              Scratch cards results include - ‚ÄúBetter luck next time‚Äù, Re. 1,

              By saving money, user receives the same number of Banksy coins as
              the percentage as they save.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Eg: User A received Rs. 1000 in April. A saves Rs, 10% savings. At
              the end of April, A receives 10 Banksy coins.
